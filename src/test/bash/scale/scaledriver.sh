Drives the overall process of scale testing the Exchange by doing these main steps:
- Uses pscp to copy the latest versions of the exchange scripts, host scripts, and certs to /tmp on each scale node
- Removes exchange org $EX_PERF_ORG to eliminate any resource leftover from a previous run (means HZN_EXCHANGE_URL, EXCHANGE_ROOTPW, and possibly EX_PERF_CERT_FILE must be set in this shell)
- Uses pssh to run the specified host script on each of the hosts in the hosts file
- Uses pslurp to copy the output from the hosts $EX_PERF_REPORT_DIR dir to the same dir on this machine (separated by hostname subdirs)
- Inspects all of the error files to report how many errors occurred

This script is dependent on the parallel-ssh suite of commands, see https://www.cyberciti.biz/cloud-computing/how-to-use-pssh-parallel-ssh-program-on-linux-unix/
for installing and using them.

The hosts-file is a simple list of hosts the scale test should be run on. The hosts are in the standard ssh format: <user>@<host-or-ip>

The host-script is a script you create in the current dir that is the top-level script that is run on each scale node.
This script can, for example, run different tests on different scale nodes by checking the scale node hostname.
It is a assumed that the host-script, and any other scripts it calls, are in the current dir. Those will all be
synced to the scale nodes.

Best practices for your host scripts:
- At the beginning remove possible output files from previous runs, so you do not have any confusing data leftover from previous runs
- Verify required software is already installed on that scale node
- Save a summary of the testing on that scale node in a file that ends with .summary
